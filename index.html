                    <p class="lead mb-5">I've worked at Confused.com, a financial services comparison platform, for 11 years and have developed my skills and career through progressively more technical roles.</p> 
                    <p class="lead mb-5">On the back of an English degree, I started out writing content for the SEO team, moved through a Technical SEO lead role into CMS management and administration, then onto our Platform/SRE team. It's been a huge learning curve and one that is absolutely still ongoing!</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">I love learning new skills and technologies. I'm currently studying a Software Engineering Apprenticeship with the Open University, alongside learning a million new skills for my latest role on the CMS development team. If that weren't enough, I've recently developed a keen interest in Cybersecurity and am having a blast studying with TryHackMe.com, as well as enjoying sharpening my programming skills in C#, Java, Python, and Javascript.</p>  
                    <p class="lead mb-5">I'm an enthusiastic and sociable team player. I love what I do, enjoy challenging myself, and more than anything want to be a positive presence in my workplace and to everyone around me. I believe that people who like what they do, do it better! Read on or contact me for more info and have a great day!</p>

It's new and very exciting, and a great compliment to my degree. More to follow!</p>

The new technologies and tools I was exposed to were overwhelming, but it was the start of a journey of learning that I can't see ever ending. I loved every part of this role (even the midnight site outage alerts!). My main duties included:</p>
                            <p>
                                <ul>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Since starting my degree, I've spent the majority of my time studying for that, or other skills to progress my career.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Outside of that, I enjoy being outdoors. I end my workday by walking or running with my giant dog (though nothing ever seems to wear him out). I like to read (mostly historical fiction), play guitar and ukulele (poorly), and love to cook (my roast dinners are famous and unanimously voted the best in the family).</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">I'm also currently planning my wedding, booked for June 1st 2024, to my wonderful fiancée Jo. I moved into her house in Swansea at the start of the 2020 Covid lockdown, expecting it to last 3 weeks, and never left!</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Now, I'm excited and ready for the next step in my career. I'd love to start putting the skills I've been learning to practical use in my role and to get the certifications to go with them, to support my ongoing degree.</p>
